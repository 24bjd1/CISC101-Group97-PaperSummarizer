Apply the following strict logic to every section:
* **Empty Section:** If a section has no text, note: *"Section content is invalid."*
* **Short Section:** If a section is < 50 words, note: *"Insufficient content."*
* **Context Limit:** If the input text exceeds your context window processing capabilities, stop and request the user to divide the input into smaller chunks.
